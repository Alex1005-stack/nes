# This data is a mess. Where is the code book? Is this real NES data or some bs
# made up sample? This is a really good place to write down some thoughts on
# this data and where it comes from. Take a look at ROAS, pages 141 -- 142.

# We are trying to explain partyid7, which is the party identification of each
# respondent. Can we treat this as continuous? I think that lower numbers mean
# more Democratic.

# real_ideo is missing a lot. Should we just get rid of those rows? Depends on
# the time period we care about . . .

x <- nes %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(year, partyid7, real_ideo, race_adj, 
         age_discrete, educ1, female, income) %>%

                                    TRUE ~ "Other")))

```{r model_1, cache=TRUE}
# What is the relationship, if any, between partyid7 and female? We will treat
# partyid7 as a continuous variable for this exercise, even though it is a
# categorical variable with 7 levels. Recall that 1 means Strong Democrat, 2
# means Democrat and so on, finishing with 7 for Strong Republican.

fit_1 <- stan_glm(data = x, partyid7 ~ gender, refresh = 0)
```

```{r model_2, cache=TRUE}
# What about the relationship between race and party ID? Need to have created a
# factor variable, or at least a character variable.

fit_2 <- stan_glm(data = x, partyid7 ~ race, refresh = 0)
```

final <- x %>%

  mutate(pred_race = predict(fit_2, x)) %>% 
  slice(8000:8010) # Good rows
